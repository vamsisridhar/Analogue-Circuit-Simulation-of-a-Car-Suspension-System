# Analogue-Circuit-Simulation-of-a-Car-Suspension-System

A car’s suspension system was modelled by building an analogue computer. It was used to solve the differential equations that described the displacement of the suspension system from equilibrium as response to the surface displacement of the road. The circuit was simulated using LTSpice and was tested with different waveforms with known solutions. The output of the circuit was within the uncertainties of the theory. γ values of 2s^−1 and 10s^−1 we used for light damping and heavy damping respectively. For the standard analogue computer, the resonant frequencies were: 1.2±0.3Hz for light damping and 0.4±0.3Hz for heavy damping. For the analogue computer with the inverted inverting differentiator, the resonant frequency for light damping was 1.3±0.6Hz.
